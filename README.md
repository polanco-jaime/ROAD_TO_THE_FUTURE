This repository contains the paper "Road to the Future: Identifying Impacts of Roads on Education in Colombia" by Jaime Polanco-Jiménez, a PhD Student in Economics at Pontifical Xavierian University & Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

## Abstract

This study evaluates the impact of the road concessions program on education in Colombia. The results reveal a decrease in the fraction of students participating in the labor force in schools located near roads, accompanied by an increase in average reading and math scores and the fraction of students completing higher education. The evidence suggests positive effects on the accumulation of human capital, with a stronger impact on public schools compared to private schools. This research provides valuable insights into the potential effects of infrastructure development on the educational outcomes of students in Colombia.
